Project - Week 2

In my project, I utilize the the THREE.JS WebGL library.  This library abstracts
some of the WebGL function calls.  This library is utilized as is, without any
modification.  In my code, I utilize their API.  Included in this is the Detector.js
file, which detects if a system and browser can support WebGL.

In order to display multiple cameras/views of the same scene, I used the method
presented on the website: https://sites.google.com/site/threejstuts/home/multiviewport.
This code was heavily modified to show three different views with my specifications,
but the general idea is similar.

Google fonts are also used on my page.
