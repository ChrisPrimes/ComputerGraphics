Homework #2 Readme

For the wheel component of this assignment, I did not use any code from
websites, books, etc.  However, for the fractal component of the assignment,
I used code from http://codingwithpassion.blogspot.com/2012/08/just-koch-snowflake-in-canvas-html5.html.
I used a few functions from this website, and heavily modified them to be useful
for this assignment.  I used the functions that drew the lines on the page,
and kept track of the angles and points between the different levels of
recursion.

The fractal.html file will run the fractal component, and the wheel.html file
will run the wheel component.
